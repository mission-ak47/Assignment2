# Assignment2

This is an Application created to capture data from the Community, Doctors, Persons, Testing centers, and Patients.

All the persons and communities have the basic login tab where the doctor and patient are added to array lists and patients are generated with a patient ID.

The community can add in the address to assign to a hospital and a doctor for a patient. 

Vital reports are added to the patient's ID for doctors' verification. 

Each encounter is also captured with the date and time stamps.
